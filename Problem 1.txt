Problem 1

                  Deign a 18 in. x 18 in. square column to carry an ultimate Axial load of 400 kips and an ultimate moment of 300 ft-kips. fc' = 6 ksi and fy = 60 ksi. Use an effective cover of 3 in. for longitudinal reinforcement. Estimate the the reinforcement ratio by averaging values from two graphs with Gamma of 0.6 and 0.75.

Problem 2

                  Deign a rectangular column (b =15 in. x h= 20 in. ) to carry an ultimate Axial load of 300 kips and an ultimate moment of 320 ft-kips. fc' = 6 ksi and fy = 60 ksi. Use an effective cover of 2.5 in. for longitudinal reinforcement. 


Design of Columns:
- Short Column Failure by "materials"
Rectangular Column: Uniaxial Bending
	(Pu,Mu) or (Pu, e)
Construct (Pu, Mu) Diagram
	Use graphs (pu, Mu) Diagrams)
	For analysis and Design
	Longitudinal Reinforcement; Ties
	h - in the bending direction
	b - in perpendicular direction
	Need to check for both Mx and My, If Mx is around My => bi-axial bending
	- Bars around perimeter, and ties

	- Ties #3 or #4 bars, clear cover: 1.5 in.

Given: From Analysis, Pu and Mu, for both Directions. x ,y
Architectural Considerations: b, h,
fc', fy
need to estimate longitudinal and tie reinforcement

If b and h and not known,
	assume h/b is around 1.0 to 1.5 - trial and adjusting
b,h, Mu, Pu, fc', fy - known
Assume: gamma between 0.6 and 0.9
	Initial say gamma = 0.75
	gamma = (h- 2*effective cover)/h
	Compute: pu/bh and Mu/bh2, e/h using graph: estimate p (ro)
	

Obtain: p_total using design charts
As total = pt * bh
Choose, size, number of bars, location
bar size: #6 to #18
ACI Code Provisions: phi: 
Puo = .... * Puo *

Longitudinal Reinforcement:
	pg >= 0.01 or Astotal = 0.01 bh
	   <= 0.08
To avoid reinforcement congestion, ro is normally less than 0.03
Interior columns: pg is around 0.01
Clear Cover: 1.5 in. Effective cover: 2.5 to 4 in.

4. Tie Reinforcement with 135 degrees angle closed tier
	
Specifications for over-lap length

Detailing - extremely important - for abnormal loading (Earthquake, )
Size and spacing of Tie Reinforcement 
If longitudinal bars are #10 or smaller: Use #2 or #4 ties
If >= #11 Use #4 ties

Spacing: S cannot be greater than 16 db diameter of longitudinal bar
	Cannot be greater han 48 db diamater of tie
	Cannot be greater than least dimension of the column
Ties provide shear strength for columns

Example 1: Design a 12 x 20 in. column with ties to ssupport: Pd = 100k, Pl=100k, Mo = 30 ft-k and Ml = 70 ft-k, fc' = 4kssi, fy = 60 ksi
b = 12 in., d = 20 in.


Pu = 280 k, Mu = 1.2x30 + 1.6*70 = 148 ft-k
e = 148*12/(280) = 6.4 in, 12 since 12 x 20 column
e/h = 6.4/ 20  = 0.32
Assume reinforcement in compression and tension side only: gamma = 0.75
 
fc' = 4ksi, fy = 60 ksi, gamma = 0.75
Choose appropriate chart:
Mu/bh2 = 148*12/12*20^2 = 0.37
Using chart or graph: pg is around 0.01
As total = 0.01*12*20 = 2.4 in2
Provide 4-#7 bars, As total = 4*0.6 = 2.4 in2 

Design of Ties:
Try #3 ties not greater than 16db of long bar = 14 in.
	48 db of ties: 18 in
	b or h 12 in
Provide # 3 ties @ 12 in. c/c

Effective cover < 2.5"?

= 20-2*2.5/20 = 0.75
if we have gamma for 0.72, interpoalte
